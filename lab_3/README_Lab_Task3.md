# Lab Task 3 – Programming Fundamentals

This repository contains solutions for Lab Task 3 of the Programming Fundamentals course at FAST University, Islamabad. The tasks focus on **Conditional Structures**, including decision-making constructs, loops, and control flow mechanisms.

## Tasks Overview

### ✅ Task 1: ASCII Sum - Even or Odd
- **Objective**: Use ASCII values and decision-making.
- **Description**:
  - Input: First name as a string.
  - Add ASCII values of all characters.
  - Output whether the sum is **Even** or **Odd**.

### ✅ Task 2: Lucas Series Generator
- **Objective**: Generate mathematical sequences.
- **Description**:
  - Input: Number of terms.
  - Output: First `n` terms of the Lucas series.
  - Sequence starts from `2, 1` and continues with each term being the sum of the previous two.

### ✅ Task 3: Prime Number Checker (Loop Until Negative)
- **Objective**: Check prime numbers with a loop.
- **Description**:
  - Input: Integer number.
  - Output: Whether the number is prime.
  - Repeat until a **negative number** is entered.

### ✅ Task 4: Nested Switch Comparison
- **Objective**: Use nested `switch-case` for comparisons.
- **Description**:
  - Input: Two integers.
  - Output: Whether the first number is greater, smaller, or equal to the second, using nested `switch`.

### ✅ Task 5: Electricity Bill Calculator (Ternary Operator)
- **Objective**: Use the ternary operator for decisions.
- **Description**:
  - Input: Units consumed.
  - Output: Bill calculated with tiered pricing:
    - `<= 50`: Rs. 0.50/unit
    - `<= 150`: Rs. 0.75/unit
    - `<= 250`: Rs. 1.20/unit
    - `> 250`: Rs. 1.50/unit
  - Add **20% surcharge** to the final bill.

### ✅ Task 6: Fibonacci Triangle
- **Objective**: Combine series with nested loops.
- **Description**:
  - Input: Limit for Fibonacci terms.
  - Output: Print a **Fibonacci triangle** using nested `for` loops.
